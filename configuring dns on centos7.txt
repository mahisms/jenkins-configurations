Configuring DNS-service:
==========================================
Pre-requists: 2 centos machines (master and slave) 
	      static ips
==> Installing dependencies:
--> yum install bind bind-utils -y
==> Configure the "/etc/name.conf" file
	options {
  			listen-on port 53 {give static ip;}
			allow quaey: allow any
			save and exit.
==> start the service
	systemctl start named
	systemctl enable named
==> check the service is working or not
	systemctl status named
==>apply the firewall
	firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=53/tcp
   	firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=53/udp
==> firewall-cmd --reload
==firewall-cmd --list-all
==>again we need to goto the /etc/named.conf file, to create zones.
  vi /etc/named.conf
  shift+G
  zone "domeain name which we want to create"
       ex:zone "example.com" IN {
 	        type master:
		file "forward.exaple.com"(it can be any thing, it should be exist on /var/named)
		allow-update { none; };
		};
(172.168.1.1)zone: ( if we want to create another zone, we ll give the ip)save and exit.
		ex: "1.168.175 in-addr-arpa" N {
		type master;
		file "reverse.example.com"(this must be in /var/named)
		allow-update { none };
	
}	
==> create a forward.exaple.com and reverse.example.com files in /var/namaed location
   cd /var/named
copy named.localhost file as forward.exaple.com
cp named.localhost forward.example.com 
 -->vi forward.exaple.com
 -->In SOA  server.exapmle.com root.example.com. (give hostname or ip) (
@	IN NS server.example.com.
@	In A  static Ip
server	In A  static ip
host	IN A  static Ip
www	IN A  static Ip
desktop IN A  static IP address( this is for client)
client	IN A  static Ip (this is for anothe rclient)
save and exit.
==> cp this forward.example.comfile as reverse.example.com
 --> cp forward.example.com reverse.example.com
vi reverse.example.com
	@	IN NS server.example.com.
@	IN NS  server.example.com(Domain name)
server	In A   example.com
host	IN A  static Ip
www	IN A  static Ip
desktop IN A  static IP address( this is for client)
client	IN A  static Ip (this is for anothe rclient)
11      IN PTR server.example.com
10	IN PTR desktop.example.com

save and exit.
-->chown root:named forward.example.com
-->chown root:named reverse.example.com
==>To check our configuration is correct or not
 --> named.checkconf -z /etc/named.conf
  --> named.check -z forward /var/named/forward.example.com
  -->named.check -z reverse /var/named/reverse.example.com
==> restart the service
  --> systemctl restart named
==> 
vi /etc/resolv.conf
   search example.com
systemctl restart NetworkManager
 chekck the connection established on the hostname
  on server: ping server
==> ping host
============================================================
on client side:
=======================
as root user:
check the hostname of the client
  --> hostname -f
    change the hostname as desktop.example.com
==>
